#### Problem 1

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass ?

### Problem 2

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of
the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one
at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60,
40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division ?
